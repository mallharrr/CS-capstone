      <h2 class="chakra-root">History of Yoga</h2>  
      <p>  
        Yoga is an ancient practice that began in India over 5,000 years ago. It was first developed by wise teachers who wanted to help people connect their minds, bodies, and spirits. Early yoga was more about breathing, meditation, and finding inner peace than about physical poses. Ancient texts called the Vedas and Upanishads were some of the first to mention yoga. Over centuries, yoga spread across India and then to the rest of the world. Today, people everywhere practice yoga for many reasons, including health, relaxation, and spiritual growth. Even though it’s thousands of years old, yoga keeps evolving and is now a big part of modern wellness routines!

      <h2 class="chakra-heart">Purpose of Yoga</h2>  
      <p>  
        The main purpose of yoga is to create harmony between your mind, body, and spirit. Yoga teaches us how to focus, breathe, and be present in the moment. It helps people become more flexible and strong, but it’s also about finding calm and reducing stress. Many people use yoga as a way to relax after a busy day or to help with anxiety. For some, yoga is a spiritual practice; for others, it's a fun way to exercise and feel better. No matter your reason, yoga can help you feel more balanced, improve your concentration, and discover a sense of inner peace that you can use in everyday life.
